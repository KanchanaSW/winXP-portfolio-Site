  bio: `I'm a Senior Software Engineer and emerging Tech Lead based in Colombo, Sri Lanka, with 4+ years of experience building scalable React and Next.js applications for enterprise SaaS products.

I specialize in end-to-end feature delivery — from product feasibility discussions and structured developer guides to coordinating parallel FE/BE workstreams that ship fast without compromising quality. I love architecting modular frontend systems, mentoring engineering teams, and implementing performance and caching solutions that reduce costs and improve UX.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring AI-assisted development tools, contributing to personal projects, or sharing what I've learned through internal tech talks.`,
